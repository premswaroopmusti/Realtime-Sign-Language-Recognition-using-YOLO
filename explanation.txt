yolo is a object detection algorithm
yolo (you only look once)
so yolo is basically Convolutional Neural Network which means that it accepts an image or a video it scans through it and it identifies objects and actions in the video or images
so we can apply this to our dataset, train the model and deploy it
imagine this as a student going to class, they need to go to a specific class
if they go to physics class they might become a physicist
if they go to an art class they might become an artist 
and yolo works the same way
so we present it with what we want it to learn 
- upload data
- train a model
Ultralytics yolo is made using pytorch
yolov5 works on the top of pytorch
leverage the base model to perform some detections, it trained on the coco data set (basically is a open source data set), so roughly we will have 80 different classes that we will be able to detect
and then we will fine tune our sign recognition model
so that we will be able to detect what sign we are showing
after that we will test this in real time 

image and its related text file - this is how yolo accepts data 
when we open the text file- first of all we will get the class name and after those are the 4 bounding box coordinates
for every image we need one text file

train.py this file is responsible to train your algorithm on your data
img 415 - this is the size of the image
batch 16 - 16 batches
custom_data - so from this file the algorithm will see where ur data is
inside custom_data 
training data is present and test data is present
no. of classes are 5 and also name of the classes are given
so from here it is getting the info about the dataset on which u want to perform ur training
we will get the yolo5s.pt weight file by default
