# Realtime-Sign-Language-Recognition-using-YOLO

## Methadology

- Collected images through webcam

- Divided the collected images into five classes (‘Hello’, ’Yes’, ’No’,
  ’I Love You’, ’Thank You’)

- Labelled the collected images according to their respective classes

- For building a Realtime face emotion recognition model, i have 
  collected the images from webcam with the help of OpenCV. 

- After the image acquisition, divided the collected images into five 
  classes (‘Hello’, ’Yes’, ’No’, ’I Love You’, ’Thank You’) and then label 
  the collected images using labelImg according to their respective 
  classes

- Split the data (images and their labels) into training and testing 
  data

- Clone repo ‘yolov5’ for object detection and after that Sign language
  recognition

- Train Custom data using Roboflow for Sign Language Recognition
